# Twitch API Wrapper

Public API that wraps around the [Twitch Helix API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) to fetch stream information. This might be expanded upon in the future.

This was made as an companion tool for [AutoVOD](https://github.com/jenslys/autovod).

**Limitation**: The Twitch API dosent return anything if the streamer is not live.
