# Twitch API Wrapper

Public API that wraps around the [Twitch Helix API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) to fetch a streams title. This might be expanded in the future.

This was made as an companion for [AutoVOD](https://github.com/jenslys/autovod).

**Limitation**: The Twitch API dosent return anything if the streamer is not live.

## Usage

`http://my-url/title/<username-here>`

## Installation
